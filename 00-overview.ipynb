    "# Introduction to Data Science with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This course aims to introduce participants to working with Python to produce information about data.  My aim is that such a definition suggests a rather fluid understanding of what can be done with Python and Data Science.  No precise definition of a Data Scientist should be sought, and instead see this as an opportunity to create your own identity using a computing language that is able to complete a wide variety of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the course, we will traverse these different capabilities of accessing, manipulating, and presenting using Python.  To begin, we introduce some basic tools like **UNIX** and **Git**, as well as using Python to access and manipulate data.  Next, we will explore some traditional models through Regression.  From here, we will explore some alternative data types and introduce Natural Language Processing and Web Scraping.  After this, we introduce additional models for Regression and Classification problems and ways to combine our early models.  Finally, we will explore some basic ideas in Deep Learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the class, you should be comfortable accessing, analyzing, and presenting a project of your own design.  "
